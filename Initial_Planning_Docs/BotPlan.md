Initial Plan is Subjected to change occasionally, without notice

Need to make two Bots

The one that is controlled Manually and
The one that is controlled by AI

Both the Bots will be clones (Prevent unfair advantages of wait or extra components)

Both the bots will have Esp32 which connects them to Server Running ROS (Underneath the table)

The Server will have 3 processes parallel to each other 

1st Process:
 Take in Manual Data from users controller and send movement data to the robot.

2nd Process:
 Takes Vision Data(Or some form of feedback from the game), make decision(Path Planning) and send movement data to the robot.

3rd Process:
  There will be a sensor placed in the Posts that will update the Servers Score Board and the server will update the physical Score Board
