Initial Plan is Subjected to change occasionally, without notice

Play Area Design:

 Play area will be designed and build later, but still some constrains are bellow.

 The Play area should be big enough to fit the 2 Robots 2 Goal Posts and 1 ball and still have enough room for movement of dynamic entities.

Posts Design:

 The Goal Posts will have a ramp so the ball slides out if the goal is scored.

 For Futuristic Look the Goal Posts Net will look Hexagonal but still same design as a standard soccer post (size ratio downed).

 There will be a sensor placed in the Posts that will update the Servers Score Board and the server will update the physical Score Board.

Score Board Design:

 The Score Board will display goals with the led matrix display or a digital screen.

 The Score Board will be connected to the server.
